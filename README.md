# Lab 1.1 Hello World

## Instructions

Download, compile, and run this lab assignment.
Make some modifications to the code, compile, and run it again.
Turn your modified code in.

## Download Code
You've already found the code (congratulations). Now, download it to your computer or import it into repl.it

## Compile and Run
Once you have the code, open it in the editor of your choice (DrJava or repl.it), then compile the code and run it.
View the results in the console of your editor.

## Modify the code
Make a few modifications to the code. Compile and run your code after each change. If your change caused a compile-error, then undo your change and try again. In the worst-case scenario, you can redownload the code and start fresh.

1. Change the code so that there is a space between the words `Hello` and `World`
2. Change the String literal value so the program outputs `Hello [YOUR NAME]` with your name in place of `[YOUR NAME]`
3. Change the String literal value so the program outputs `Hello Dragon`
4. Turn your code in by uploading it to mrmaycs.com/turnitin

## Grading
Your code will be automatically graded by comparing its output to the expected output:

```
Hello Dragon
```

Your output must match the expected output exactly in order to receive any credit.
